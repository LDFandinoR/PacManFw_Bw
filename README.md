# PacManForwardBackwards

This is one of my first repositories from  Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN with MIT XPro. This repository contains a PacMan animation that goes forward and backward. The PacMan starts its movement from left to write and the direction change is based on the webpage width; when the PacMan image border touches the right window edge it changes the PacMan's direction.
